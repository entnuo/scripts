A few scripts that I use in my laptop. There's —probably— a description inside every script explaning what are its uses.

`mv-scripts.sh` is a simple script to move everything inside this repository to `${HOME}/.scripts`, a folder where a store my scripts. If the directory doesn't exist, it will create one and copy-and-paste everything there. This is useful since some softwares might want to execute something in there —for instance: bspwm and startx use some files when starting up— and it's kind of "hardcoded."

If you use a different setup, ignore what's written above and copy-and-paste where you want.
